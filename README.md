# Ultrasonic Radar with Arduino

## Overview

This project uses an Arduino Nano, a servo motor, and an ultrasonic sensor to create a basic radar system. The radar sweeps 180 degrees, measures distances at various angles, and can be used for a variety of applications such as object detection and distance measurement.

## Components

- Arduino Nano: The microcontroller board used to control the radar system.
- Servo Motor: Provides rotational movement for sweeping the radar.
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Measures distance by emitting and receiving ultrasonic waves.
- Jumper Wires: For connecting the components.
- Breadboard: Optional, for easier wiring connections.
- Power Supply: Can be a USB connection to the Arduino or an external battery pack.
